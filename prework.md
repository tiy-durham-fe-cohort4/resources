# Cohort 4, Front-End Prework

## Learn HTML and CSS

[Here's](http://www.amazon.com/HTML-CSS-Design-Build-Websites/dp/1118008189/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1422485062&sr=8-1&keywords=html+and+css)
a book that many people highly reccommend on the subject. Give it a go, if
books are your thing.

Be really familiar with when you'd use these CSS rules:

- position: fixed
- position: relative
- position: absolute
- margin
- padding
- border
- background
- color

There are lots of great resources for learning CSS/HTML.

Here's one:

Here's another:

I personally prefer just reading about it on MDN:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background

And tinkering with it here:

http://codepen.io/pen/

Take a stab at laying out a real website using HTML and CSS. Here's one, if you
don't want to find your own: https://www.mint.com/

Try to build that yourself with CSS and HTML. The further you get, the easier
your first week will be!

## Next, get familiar with JavaScript

Definitely read this. The first 5-6 chapters are the most pertinent:

And then do some CodeCademy JavaScript exercises. The more familiarity with JS
you have, the better!

Read some MDN articles on it:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript

... and play with it here:

http://jsbin.com/?html,js,output

## Set up your Mac:

Install git:

https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/

And learn about git. (GitHub has some great tutorials on it.)

Install Node:

http://nodejs.org/download/

And make sure that when you type npm in the terminal, you don't get a big error
screen!

## Learn a Bit About Fonts

See if you can find good answers to these questions:

1. What's the optimal font-size? Is there one?
2. Is there an optimal ratio between font-size and line-height?
3. Is there an optimal line-length/column-width (hint: sort of)? What is it?
