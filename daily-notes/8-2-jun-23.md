## Homework

You've got some choices, but it would be a good idea to play with Node.

### Fix Reshare

- Make the API restful... you should be able to put to /api/res/:id to update a resource
- Add fields to the API (maybe a title field to the shares object, for example)
- Add validation into the API
  - URLs should actually be URLs, starting w/ http:// or https://
  - URLs should be required
  - Description should be required
  - etc

### Add a back-end to the Appointments application

- Remember the appointments app?
- Create a Node API to CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) appointments
- Call this from your appointments app, instead of `localStorage`

### Or come up with your own

- Think up an application you'd like to write that requires a back-end
- Write it using Node!
