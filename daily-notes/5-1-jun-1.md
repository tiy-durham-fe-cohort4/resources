## Homework

Scan through this review document, and dig into the parts that cause you to
struggle the most:

[Midterm review](https://github.com/tiy-durham-fe-cohort4/resources/blob/master/assignments/midterm.md)

- If it's CSS selectors, try playing the bento game again
- If it's CSS rules, read about and play with the rules in the midterm list
- If it's JavaScript data manipulation, do some coderbyte challenges
- If it's jQuery DOM manipulation build out a few widgets from the widgets
assignment or read through the jQuery API summaries here:
  - https://api.jquery.com/category/manipulation/
  - https://api.jquery.com/category/events/
- If it's AJAX, play with the API that we used in class
- If it's templating, build some UIs from the midterm using a temlating engine
- If it's routing, build a simple single-page application that says "hi X" where
X is a route parameter...
  - (e.g. if I go to `#hi/chris` it says 'Hi, Chris' or `#hi/kelly` it says 'Hi, Kelly')
