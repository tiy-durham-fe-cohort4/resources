## 3 Bold backgrounds need timid foregrounds

- If you *do* use a bold background, other content should be muted
- Avoid 2 big, bold colors taking up massive real estate at once

## 4 Don't get fancy with fonts

## 6 Minimize animations and movement

- They're distracting and annoying
- Subtlety is key
- Should serve as hints or to aid transitions triggered by user actions

---

## 7 Things should look like what they are

- Buttons should look like buttons
- Links should look like links (or buttons)
- Inputs should look like inputs
- Don't break convention unless you've got a damn good reason... and you don't
- Edgy promo pages are the (possible) sole exception

## Remember: apps !== promo pages

- Marketing/promo pages can be flashier
  - They exist to lure people in
  - People aren't expected to stay on the promo page for long
- ... but I *hate* promo pages that
    - Don't get to the point
    - Don't have a clear "click here to do what you want"
- Apps should be conservative: no one wants to
  - Stare at a garishly bright screen for hours
  - Have something whizzing and swirling in their peripheral vision for hours

## ~ Break these rules

- But know *why* you're breaking them
