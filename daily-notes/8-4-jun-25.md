## Lecture

Let's build an app using [some data](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/bridges/)

We will load some data from a dataset, allow users to search it, and visualize some statistics about the data the user selects.

There will be at least 2 pages: the search page, and the result detail page where the stats are shown

Here's our gameplan:

- Clone the [gulp-base](https://github.com/tiy-durham-fe-cohort4/gulp-base) project
- Remove the `.git` folder and initialize git
- Grab our dataset [from here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/bridges/) and store it locally
- Modify Gulp to copy `.data` files to the distribution folder
- Use AJAX to pull our dataset into our app
- Parse the dataset (maybe using regular expressions)
- Create a template to display our data as a list
- Pull in the [SortedRouter](https://gist.github.com/chrisdavies/b56d1011cd9ca9394d86)
- Move the list view logic into its own controller and make it the default route
- Import all controllers from the init.js
  - var bulk = require('bulk-require');
  - bulk(__dirname, ['controllers/**/*.js']);
- Add a route/controller for the details page
- Make each item in the list link to the details page for that item
- The details page should show:
  - The item details as text
  - A vizualization comparing the item to the rest of the list using [c3](https://github.com/tiy-durham-fe-2015/c3-demo)
