# Week 7, Day 3, Jun 17 2015

## Lecture

- Review of JavaScript, jQuery, Regular Expressions, Routing, Templating, AJAX, etc

## Homework

[Read Mason Stewart's Backbone intro and do the exercises](https://gist.github.com/chrisdavies/4559bbd92475ca7bae01)

If you have already done that, then you can choose one of these:

- [Start reading the Backbone docs](http://backbonejs.org/)
  - Take a former project (say, Etsy, user management, or appointments) and try using Backbone models, views, and routing
- [One or more jQuery widgets](https://github.com/tiy-durham-fe-cohort4/resources/blob/master/assignments/js-widgets.md)
  - The Squarespace-style slideout menu is a good one
  - So is the auto-growing textarea
  - Or the drag/move elements exercises there (do those without using a jQuery drag/drop plugin)
- [Lots o' CoderByte](http://coderbyte.com/CodingArea/Challenges/)
  - If you feel that basic logic is still a weak spot, do a handful of these
  - Time-box it (spend no more than a couple of hours on it and then read Mason's Backbone intro)
