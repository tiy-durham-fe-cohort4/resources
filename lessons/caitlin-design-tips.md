# Caitlin's Design Tips

Caitlin, the designer from Adwerx who guest lectured for us, compiled this handy list of dos and donts. Follow this advice!!!

Also, we compiled a table today after reviewing some other sites. That can be found 
[here](https://github.com/tiy-durham-fe-cohort4/resources/blob/master/daily-notes/9-3-jul-1.md).

## 1. Start with three colors: black, white, and a medium gray. 

If you can’t design it with these three colors, you can’t design it with any colors. When you do start to add in colors, use this tool [colourco.de](http://colourco.de/) on the monochromatic + dark gray mode so that all your colors look good together.

## 2. Don’t get fancy with fonts. 

Actually, don’t even think about fonts. Just use one typeface (font) with lots of weights. That will allow you to think about HOW you’re using fonts rather than which ones you’re using. Seriously—*DON’T THINK ABOUT FONTS*. Just use the ones on this list that match the feel you’re going for. They’re free Google fonts, because free is good and Google web fonts are easy. And if you're designing a mockup before you design the real thing you can easily download all these fonts to your computer for free.
 
- Friendly & Modern: Lato
- Doing something techy? Source Sans Pro for regular copy / Source Code Pro for code snippets
- Want to look exactly like Android? Roboto
- Totally set on using a serif font? Merriweather
- Is your all-serif website feeling overwhelming and messy? Swap in Merriweather Sans for your headers. 

*NOW STOP THINKING ABOUT FONTS.*

## 3. Originality is overrated.

One of the most famous quotes in design, by one of the most famous designers is “Don’t try to be original, just try to be good”. The reason it’s famous is because it’s true. The way that you follow this quote is by: 

- Following design patterns. These are patterns to an interaction that people already know how to use. Do not reinvent interaction patterns. You can search for interaction patterns here: http://zurb.com/patterntap
- Seriously, don't get fancy. If you see something that works well, adapt that structure and style to your needs. 

## 4. Everything we do is for other people. 

Attach your ego to how happy people are while using your code, and nothing else.
