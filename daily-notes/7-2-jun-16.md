# Week 7, Day 2, Jun 16 2015

## Lecture

- Review CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Routing, Templates, etc

## Homework

[Read last week's feedback](https://github.com/tiy-durham-fe-cohort4/resources/blob/master/feedback/week6.md)

Do one of these layouts. If you want to do hard mode, implement as many of the interactions as you can!

- Use a web-font
- Use an icon font

If you don't want to use images from these sites (and you probably shouldn't), [grab some legal placeholders from 
elsewhere](http://www.pexels.com/) instead.

If you want to try doing the background video thing, with a little effort, you can use a YouTube or Vimeo video. 

### Layouts

- [Nest](https://nest.com/)
  - Note the menus when you hover over the links in the page-nav
  - Note the way the banner fades to a different promo after a while or when you click left/right
- [ESPN media](https://mediadistribution.espn.com/)
  - Note the videos playing in the background
  - Watch how the header changes when you scroll
  - Look at the hover-effects on the cards a few sections down
- [Norm and Robert](http://normandrobert.com/)
  - Again with the video (maybe don't worry about it)
  - Note how things slide in as you scroll
  - Note what happens to the image and text when you hover over a tile
- [One or more jQuery widgets](https://github.com/tiy-durham-fe-cohort4/resources/blob/master/assignments/js-widgets.md)
  - The Squarespace-style slideout menu is a good one
  - So is the auto-growing textarea
  - Or the drag/move elements exercises there (do those without using a jQuery drag/drop plugin)
